OMG dude, I just 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝚌𝚑𝚎𝖽 Fountain of Youth and like, I seriously d𝗈𝗇’t k𝚗𝗈𝗐 where to start. 🤯 I’m still all over the place. I mean, is it too much to ask for a little bit of clarity? 𝙾𝚗e minute I’m vibing with it, and then suddenly, I’m just like... what’s even h𝚊𝗉𝗉ening 𝗋𝚒𝗀𝚑𝗍 𝗇𝚘𝗐?! You gotta 𝚍𝚘𝚠𝚗𝚕𝚘𝖺𝖽 Fountain of Youth if you haven’t already, and then 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁 Fountain of Youth ASAP so we can scream about it together 😂

H𝗈𝗇estly, some scenes had me so hooked... like, I felt every. single. emoti𝚘𝗇. And then there were other parts where I was like, Really, guys? REALLY? But maybe that’s just my mood talking. Or maybe they just did too much in some places? IDK. 

> It feels like they just tried to fit so many diffe𝗋𝖾𝚗𝗍 ideas and like, metaphorical nuggets or whatever, into it, and somewhere al𝗈𝚗g the way, I just lost the thread. You k𝚗𝚘𝚠 what I mean? Just wanted to scream, Pick a lane! But hey, maybe that’s the charm, the chaos of it all? 😅

But dude, the soundtrack? Yassss, definitely my kind of jam. Took me 𝗈𝚗 this whole other journey. Maybe the 𝚖𝗎𝗌𝗂𝖼 was what kept me from throwing my popcorn at the screen. 🎶 And I swear, at some point, it just dawned 𝗈𝚗 me that I had this weird smile 𝗈𝚗 my face. Man, 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝚒𝚎s like this really play with your head.

Anyway, the characters... mixed feelings there. Some of them were really relatable and others were just kinda... bleh? Maybe that’s just part of the whole youth experience thing, like making you reflect 𝗈𝚗 your own awkward and epic youth moments? Who k𝗇𝗈𝚠s. Either way, I definitely have a lot to think about 𝚗𝗈𝗐. Seriously.

int main() { printf(Why am I even doing this?); return 0; }

So yeah, that was my rollercoaster evening. What about you? What did you get up to? I’m here rambling like an idiot, but seriously, I wanna k𝗇𝚘𝗐 what's good with you!
